Parameters:
  AdministratorAccountId:
    Type: String
    Description: "AWS account number for StackSets administration account (where parent StackSets will be created). Leave blank if using ordinary CloudFormation instead of StackSets, or if AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole existed before this stack was created."
    MinLength: 0
    MaxLength: 12
  AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleStatus:
    Type: String
    Description: "Status of the service role for CloudFormation StackSets, AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole, in current account (a StackSets target account, where child CloudFormation stacks will be created)"
    AllowedValues:
      - "Role does not exist"
      - "Role exists, AdministratorAccess policy attached"
      - "Role exists, CloudFormationFullAccess and StackSetExecutionMisc attached"
      - "Role exists, policies above not attached"
      - "Role irrelevant; using ordinary CloudFormation, not StackSets"
      # In the rare case where the CloudFormationFullAccess and
      # CloudFormationStackSetExecutionMisc IAM policies exist (from a prior
      # installation) but are no longer attached to the role, the user should
      # re-attach them, or simply delete them, before answering this question.
      # Custom-name-related limitations prevent using a CloudFormation
      # template to attach the pre-existing policies to the pre-existing role.
    Default: "Role irrelevant; using ordinary CloudFormation, not StackSets"
  LambdaCodeS3Bucket:
    Type: String
    Description: "Name of the S3 bucket where AWS Lambda function source code is stored. (For multi-region or CloudFormation StackSets scenarios, an S3 bucket with this name PLUS a region suffix, e.g., my-bucket-us-east-1, must exist in EACH target region, and must contain the SAME source code file, readable by EVERY target AWS account.)"
  TagSchedOpsCloudFormationStackNamePrefix:
    Type: String
    Description: "First part of the name of TagSchedOps CloudFormation stacks. (If you plan to create the TagSchedOps stack in one or more regions, using CloudFormation with an assumed role, and without StackSets, the name of each such stack must start with the prefix that you specify here.)"
    Default: "TagSchedOps"

Conditions:
  AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleCreate:
    !Equals [ !Ref AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleStatus, "Role does not exist" ]
